Hello, Awesome World! I'm Sahil Dawka - another pseudorandom person. 

## This is the beginning of another adventure. 

I love adventures! They are exciting (and difficult, forcing you to grow)! I migrated my website to Jekyll in the name of organization and decluttering. Jekyll is awesome! You can easily separate the content and structure of your website, which makes life a lot easier, like whe you want to autogenerate static (read:snappy) pages with changes across all of them. Did I mention free hosting on Github pages?

So far so good. 

## What is it (a) good for?
> Absolutely something

This is basically the place I share whatever I have with whoever is listening. 

I can't really say what all it is about, since I'm in the process of discovering that. 

I'm beginning to accept living with purposelessness. Not having a cool and concise mission statement for your life is _actually okay_.. who would've thought!

Thank you for listening!

Now to the interesting stuff! 

What you'll find here is more rumination, about the temporal world in various forms. I am interested in technology, and concerned about the lack of responsibility with which our species weilds it. ***"Every voice counts"***, I've been told, so this here is mine. I will write mainly in two styles - stories about technological advances and related considerations, or tutorial style knowledge transferrence posts.


Hmm.. so what do I love?

I love thinking, logic, irrationality, and all that we've done with it! 

Think about it, or better yet, feel it. We are alive, but we are not life. We have been given life, and (cooperatively,) we can make life. We also consume life to stay alive. We also exercise and all that, to stay alive, but not much else. We know how we are staying alive but can't control it (all the better, with decreasing attention spans..). Our body is made entirely of things we can study and know quite a bit about, yet it is a machine of intricacy beyond our capability to completely _comprehend_, let alone _construct_. The brain and mind, a whole other (incomplete) story!

But we **have** constructed other things, most of which didn't exist. We **are** gaining precision and accuracy in control of materials. Just look at what is possible today from the eyes of a curious (and un*educated*) child - is it not magic? Solar cells, quantum computing, bio-hacking, and so much more! All around you is the miracle of life!

There is no blessing that cannot be made a curse by changing contexts. And so does our species squander it's potential like a spoilt child who can't be bothered. Let the whales get choke on plastic, as long as it is out of sight. Besides deleting the existence of other life, we aren't even seriously considering the finitude of our own. Personally, I wouldn't mind living forever. If I am not to kill myself, I am to enjoy life, and embrace suffering, intelligently choosing my battles. There's enough on Earth for a more than a few lifetimes, so there isn't the risk of getting bored mad. With true acceptance of life, there is only trip after trip. Rest becomes a crucial (temporary) death. It's exhausting, and hard to be consistent at, given that (like 'flow') it can't be bent to conscious will. It is an ideal, like the perfect circle, it doesn't exist, except as an idea, or a meme. So too, are the Laws more like principles of Nature. However Nature, unlike us humans, is always honorable to her principles, be they defined inherently ever so loose. Yet mere knowledge of the principles isn't enough - applied knowledge is power. 


Besides this externally directed curiosity, there is a separate but related curiosity directed inwards, as my experience/attention tries to bend/fold/look/turn in on itself. I want to know how I work, and perhaps some of those principles can be generalized (depending on the scope of their methods and variables) to how all people work. I want to understand understanding, and how it is done, so that it too may be replicated and improved upon. That's artificial intelligence, which is our best attempt at creating '_real_' (or more like '_any_') intelligence. To this end, programming languages are useful tools to be comfortable with, so some posts will be motivated by that too.
