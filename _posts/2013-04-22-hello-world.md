Hello, Awesome World! I'm Sahil Dawka. Pleasure to semi-make your acquaintance!

## This is the beginning of another adventure. 

I migrated my website to Jekyll in the name of organization and decluttering.

So far so good. Chose a minimal theme, now all that's left is to port my content here. Easier said than done, since it is scattered across the far reaches of cyberspace (and my mind).

## What is it (a) good for?
> Absolutely something

This is basically the place I share whatever I have with whoever is listening. 

I can't really say what all it is about, since I'm in the process of discovering that. 

I'm beginning to accept living with purposelessness. Not having a cool and concise mission statement for your life is _actually okay_.. who would've thought! :P

Rumination aside, what you'll find here is more rumination, about the temporal world in various forms. I am interested in technology, and concerned about the lack of responsibility with which our species weilds it. ***"Every voice counts"***, I've been told, so this here is mine.

Thank you for listening!

Now to the interesting stuff!
