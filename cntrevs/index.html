	<div class="abstract">Worldwide commercial interest in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is reflected in a production capacity that presently exceeds several thousand tons per year. Currently, bulk CNT powders are incorporated in diverse commercial products ranging from <span class="hl">rechargeable batteries, automotive parts, and sporting goods to boat hulls and water filters</span>. Advances in CNT synthesis, purification, and chemical modification are enabling integration of CNTs in thin-film electronics and large-area coatings. Although not yet providing compelling mechanical strength or electrical or thermal conductivities for many applications, CNT yarns and sheets already have promising performance for applications including <span class="hl">supercapacitors, actuators, and lightweight electromagnetic shields</span>.</div>

	<div class="abstract">Flexible electronics offer a wide-variety of applications such as flexible circuits, flexible displays, flexible solar
cells, skin-like pressure sensors, and conformable RFID tags. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising
material for flexible electronics, both as the channel material in field-effect transistors (FETs) and as
transparent electrodes, due to their high intrinsic carrier mobility, conductivity, and mechanical flexibility.
In this feature article, we review the recent progress of CNTs in flexible electronics by describing both the
processing and the applications of CNT-based flexible devices. To employ CNTs as the channel material in
FETs, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are used. There are generally two methods of depositing
SWNTs on flexible substrates—transferring CVD-grown SWNTs or solution-depositing SWNTs. Since CVDgrown
SWNTs can be highly aligned, they often outperform solution-processed SWNT films that are
typically in the form of random network. However, solution-based SWNTs can be printed at a large-scale
and at low-cost, rendering them more appropriate for manufacturing. In either case, the removal of
metallic SWNTs in an effective and a scalable manner is critical, which must still be developed and
optimized. Nevertheless, promising results demonstrating SWNT-based flexible circuits, displays, RFdevices,
and biochemical sensors have been reported by various research groups, proving insight into the
exciting possibilities of SWNT-based FETs. In using carbon nanotubes as transparent electrodes (TEs), two
main strategies have been implemented to fabricate highly conductive, transparent, and mechanically
compliant films—superaligned films of CNTs drawn from vertically grown CNT forests using the “drydrawing”
technique and the deposition or embedding of CNTs onto flexible or stretchable substrates. The
main challenge for CNT based TEs is to fabricate films that are both highly conductive and transparent.
These CNT based TEs have been used in stretchable and flexible pressure, strain, and chemical and
biological sensors. In addition, they have also been used as the anode and cathode in flexible light
emitting diodes, solar cells, and supercapacitors. In summary, there are a number of challenges yet to
overcome to optimize the processing and performance of CNT-based flexible electronics; nonetheless,
CNTs remain a highly suitable candidate for various flexible electronic applications in the near future.</div>

	<div class="abstract"> The innovation on the low dimensional nanomaterials brings the rapid
growth of nano community. Developing the controllable production and
commercial applications of nanomaterials for sustainable society is highly
concerned. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with sp 2 carbon bonding,
excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal, as well as transport properties are
selected as model nanomaterials to demonstrate the road of nanomaterials
towards industry. The engineering principles of the mass production and
recent progress in the area of CNT purifi cation and dispersion are described,
as well as its bulk application for nanocomposites and energy storage.
The environmental, health, and safety considerations of CNTs, and recent
progress in CNT commercialization are also included. With the effort from
the CNT industry during the past 10 years, the price of multi-walled CNTs
have decreased from 45 000 to 100 $ kg − 1 and the productivity increased to
several hundred tons per year for commercial applications in Li ion battery
and nanocomposites. When the prices of CNTs decrease to 10 $ kg − 1
 , their
applications as composites and conductive fi llers at a million ton scale can
be anticipated, replacing conventional carbon black fi llers. Compared with
traditional bulk chemicals, the controllable synthesis and applicationsof CNTs
on a million ton scale are still far from being achieved due to the challenges
in production, purifi cation, dispersion, and commercial application. The basic
knowledge of growth mechanisms, effi cient and controllable routes for CNT
production, the environmental and safety issues, and the commercialization
models are still inadequate. The gap between the basic scientifi c research and
industrial development should be bridged by multidisciplinary research for the
rapid growth of CNT nano-industry.</div>

	<div class="abstract">Carbon nanotube (CNT) networks are an emerging class of material with potential applications
that range from biotechnology to sensors. However, the design and fabrication of CNT
networks with specific properties necessitates a deep understanding on how a variety of
factors affect the performance of these materials. Of particular interest is how the substrate
on which the CNT networks are assembled also influences on the applicational
aspects of the CNT network. In this review, we overview the variety of substrates reported
as CNT networks supports, and the different applications of these networks. Substrates can
be varied from rigid to flexible to porous materials. Interestingly, the method of network
preparation and the nature of the scaffold have a direct influence on the properties and
the potential applications of the final material.</div>

"Potential and prospective implementation of carbon nanotubes on next generation aircraft and space vehicles: a review of current and expected applications in aerospace sciences." Progress in Aerospace Sciences 70 (2014): 42-68.</div>
	<div class="abstract">Carbon nanotubes have instigated the interest of many different scientific fields since their authenticated introduction, more than two decades ago. Particularly in aerospace applications, the potential implementations of these advanced materials have been predicted to have a large impact on future aircraft and space vehicles, mainly due to their distinct features, which include superior mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. This article provides the very first consolidated review of the imminent prospects of utilizing carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles in aerospace sciences, based on their recent implementations and predicted future applications. Explicitly, expected carbon nanotube employment in aeronautics and astronautics are identified for commercial aircraft, military aircraft, rotorcraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites, and space launch vehicles. Attention is devoted to future utilization of carbon nanotubes, which may comprise hydrogen storage encapsulation, composite material implementation, lightning protection for aircraft, aircraft icing mitigation, reduced weight of airframes/satellites, and alleviation of challenges related to future space launch. This study further sheds light onto recent actualized implementations of carbon nanotubes in aerospace applications, as well as current and prospective challenges related to their usage in aerospace sciences, encompassing health and safety hazards, large scale manufacturing, achievement of optimum properties, recycling, and environmental impacts.</div>

	<div class="abstract">Recent progresses in research on several key thermal features and potential applications of carbon nanotubes-laden nanofluids are reviewed and addressed. Besides briefing on the preparation of these nanofluids, available studies on conduction, convection and boiling heat transfers of this specific class of nanofluids are discussed in detail. Effects of different parameters such as concentration of carbon nanotube and temperature on thermal conductivity, convective heat transfer coefficient, and boiling critical heat flux are also demonstrated. It is found that despite inconsistencies among available data and inconclusive heat transfer mechanisms, substantial increase in these thermal features of carbon nanotubes-nanofluids compared to their base fluids remain undisputed. In addition to the work on specific heat and thermal diffusivity, available theoretical models and heat transfer mechanisms of this particular type of nanofluids are presented and discussed. Research on a new class of nanofluids termed as “ionanofluids” is also reported. Review reveals that ionanofluids exhibit superior thermal properties compared to their base ionic liquids and these properties further increase with increasing concentration of carbon nanotube as well as fluid temperature to some extent. Carbon nanotubes based both nanofluids and ionanofluids show great potential as advanced heat transfer fluids in many important applications.

	<div class="abstract">We review experimental and theoretical work on electrical percolation of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in polymer composites. We give a comprehensive survey of published data together with an attempt of systematization. Parameters like CNT type, synthesis method, treatment and dimensionality as well as polymer type and dispersion method are evaluated with respect to their impact on percolation threshold, scaling law exponent and maximum conductivity of the composite.
